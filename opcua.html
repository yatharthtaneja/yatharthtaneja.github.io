    <h2>Executive Summary </h2>

    Our project is structured into two key phases to ensure a user-centric approach and effective product development.

    <br><br><b>Phase 1: Requirements Gathering</b>

    <br>In this phase, we focused on establishing comprehensive requirements by engaging in contextual inquiries with five participants. This involved identifying user roles, goals, workflows, and pain points to create a detailed requirements document. The users, from diverse domains such as the process sector, research and development, and Manufacturing Analytics as a Service, provided insights into developing applications that communicate with DCS/SCADA systems, model-based engineering, and OPC-UA communication protocol integration. 

    <br><br><b>Phase 2: Usability Testing</b>

    <br>Following the requirements gathering, we moved into usability testing of the newly designed application. This phase involved an additional set of five users to evaluate the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the application. The insights gained from this testing were instrumental in refining the product to better meet user expectations and enhance overall usability.

    <br>Together, these phases have positioned us to deliver a robust, user-focused application, with a tentative rollout planned for July 2025.

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/icomm/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_topnav" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">
    Industrial Communication Toolbox
    </a> by MathWorks provides access to live and historical industrial plant data directly from MATLAB and Simulink. You can read, write, and log OPC Unified Architecture (UA) data from devices such as distributed control systems, supervisory control and data acquisition systems, and programmable logic controllers. You can also access plant and manufacturing data directly from AVEVA PI System, and use this data for process monitoring, process improvement, and predictive maintenance applications.

    <p> 
        <br> <h4>1.1 What is OPC UA?</h4>

        OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is an industrial communication standard developed by the 
        <a href="https://opcfoundation.org/" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;"> 
        OPC Foundation </a>
        . OPC is vendor independent and supports all major industrial automation platforms.
        
        OPC UA is a data exchange standard for safe, reliable, manufacturer-independent, and platform-independent industrial communication. It enables secure data exchange between hardware platforms from different vendors and across operating systems.
        
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h4> 1.2 The challenge </h4>
        
        Currently, we support basic APIs for OPC UA usage in MATLAB. With the deprecation of the OPC DA toolbox, we are challenged to innovate and enhance our support for OPC UA, the new industry standard. While third-party solutions exist, our goal is to leverage the MathWorks ecosystem to deliver a unique OPC UA experience by integrating MATLAB's powerful analytics and simulation capabilities. This involves designing a tool that excels in ease-of-use and functionality, and rigorously testing it with users to ensure its effectiveness before development and public release.

  </figure>  
  
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Contextual Inquiry:</b> Contextual inquiries were performed on the use cases of OPC UA. These insights were captured in both the report and on Miro.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3.3 Some insights from Usability study</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The current user interface terminology can lead to confusion:</b> Users struggle to differentiate between similar concepts such as Configure with adding nodes to the table, "Logging the data" with saving/ recording the data.</li>
    <li><b>It is difficult to associate the nodes:</b> In the monitoring table and drop down in node information with their corresponding hierarchy in the address space.</li>
    <li><b>For basic read and write operations:</b> Users do not prefer the node functions panel. However, they expect a safeguard mechanism to prevent erroneous or harmful data modifications.</li>
    <li><b>To support use cases for monitoring and exploring the nodes:</b> We will need to provide additional functionality, such as unit information, the quality of incoming data, and sampling frequency.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The study enabled us to establish clear requirements at an early stage, significantly reducing the time and iterations typically needed to refine product specifications—potentially saving multiple 6-month release cycles. By focusing on user-centric design, we developed a product that effectively meets user needs, supported by several rounds of internal design reviews and externally validated usability studies. This approach ensured a well-informed, user-driven development process, enhancing the product's relevance and usability from the outset.

    <br> The application is tentatively planned for rollout in July 2025, aligning with our strategic timeline for delivering impactful solutions to our users.
